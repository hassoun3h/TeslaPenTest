# TeslaPenTest
We conducted a penetration test on a Tesla Model 3 using the PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard) guidelines. Overall, Tesla seems very secure against cybersecurity attacks. They have implemented safeguards and with their defense-in-depth approach through security modes such as Sentry Mode, Valet Mode, Cabin camera, security alarm, and intrusion sensors, they should remain secure. However, their main security focus is security through obscurity, so we believe that, if more information about the car systems gets disclosed, it'll be easier to break those systems.
